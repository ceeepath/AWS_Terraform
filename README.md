# AWS_Terraform
My IaC Repo for managing AWS services.

## Initial Preparations
I will be making use of gitpod for my IDE for this project. To make sure my IDE is always properly configured, I added tasks to install required tools every time I relaunch gitpod. For now, the two tasks I added are Tasks to Install AWS CLI and Terraform using the installation scripts.

### Setting Environmental Variables
The command to set environmental variables on Linux Terminal
```sh
export ENV_NAME='value'
```

To persist it in gitpod
```sh
gp env ENV_NAME='value'
```
